# Backend Challenge Exercise

Evaluation of the architectural decisions made in this Fastify JavaScript project:

Project Structure: The project follows a modular structure by separating routes, services, repositories, and controllers into different files and directories. This modular approach helps in organizing the codebase and improving maintainability.

Routing: Routes are defined using Fastify's routing capabilities, where each route corresponds to a specific HTTP method and endpoint. Fastify's get, put, etc., methods are used to define routes for handling different types of requests.

Input Validation: Input validation is performed for the /search and /put/:id routes using Fastify's schema validation feature.

Error Handling: Error handling is implemented in the routes to handle cases where job offers are not found or when there are errors during request processing. HTTP status codes such as 404 are used to indicate resource not found errors, and appropriate error messages are sent back to the client.

Response Formatting: Responses are formatted as JSON objects using Fastify's reply.send() method. Data is extracted from the job offer objects and sent back to the client in a structured format.

Testing: Unit tests are implemented using the tap testing framework to ensure the correctness of the jobOfferService module and route handlers. Tests cover scenarios such as fetching job offers by ID and handling HTTP requests to specific routes.
